                Our runnable file is DataAssessment.ipynb and DataAssessment.py
                If you have jupyter notebook, you can run DataAssessment.ipynb directly, otherwise, you should run DataAssessment.py
                Before running them, you need to install some packages first: pandas, numpy, dateutil, re, datetime, collections, tensorflow, textdistance, sklearn
                Really sorry for unconvenience
